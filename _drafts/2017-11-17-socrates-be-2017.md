Thursday 9 November until Sunday 12 November marked the third SoCraTes Belgium unconference. I'm not going to fully explain the concept, I've done that before (TODO link) and others can do that better anyway (TODO link to Koen). Just a quick rundown of things I picked up and contributed to.

# Java 9 module system
Java 9 is out for about two months now, so I hoped there would be others around that already had some experience and could help me with the first steps. I haven't heard of anyone going full-blown on modules yet in their production systems, but a few people were experimenting on a reasonably clean kata, trying to modularize it.

I took away that the module path is a whole new system built next to the classpath, with the possibility to fully replace the classpath. Modules live on the module path and can only interact via the classes they explicitly expose by their contracts. When compiling and running Java code, you need to mention the module path next to the classpath.

I seems as if the tooling (Gradle, Maven, IntelliJ IDEA, ...) is not fully up to date yet, or at least somewhat hard to use in a module path + classpath mixed world. For now we used `javac` and `java` from the command line, but that obviously doesn't scale. Could be that we just didn't do enough research yet on the tools.

Modules usually expose entire packages, hiding other packages (such as a `.impl` subpackage). This allows us to structure our code in packages that can freely communicate with other packages in the same module, without exposing implementation details to code outside the module. This is very different from how we used to organize and encapsulate Java code!

My thoughts: while I heard many people say we needed a new version of Effective Java for Java 8, I wasn't convinced lambdas and streams were invasive enough to hugely impact our way of working - it mostly seemed like very welcome syntactic sugar that allowed a little bit more decomposition. I find it harder to wrap my head around the implications of the module system. It might be that I haven't encountered the boundaries yet and need more exercise. Or it might be that the module system is actually very invasive in the way we design Java code, and if so, then I think a new Effective Java will help us (as an industry) save countless hours of frustration and rework.

Another part of the module system is the `jlink` tool, that allows a developer to build a native package that bundles the JRE, no dependencies needed. In fact, the module system allows us to only package those parts of the JRE that we need to run our application. This might be usable to solve an annoying distribution problem at work. On the flip side, if you distribute such an app to customers, you will need to update the app for security updates that are published for the JRE.

Thank you Guido, Dom√©nique, Gert and Franky for your work and your explanations, it was at exactly the level I needed!
