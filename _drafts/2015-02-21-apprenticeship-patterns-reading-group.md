At [Cegeka][Cegeka], we believe in continuous learning, and we regularly organize reading groups as a simple and effective way to gain knowledge. The last reading group I participated in, and the one that inspired this blog, was [Apprenticeship Patterns][AppPatt]. We kept extensive notes during our reading and discussions. You can find these below. Please comment!
