After reading the excellent book [Apprenticeship Patterns][AppPatt] by Hoover and Oshineye I decided I needed a blog.

I hope this blog will be useful to share the things I learn.

I hope it will be useful for future reference, for myself, for you, for colleagues.

I hope to get you thinking.

I hope my opinions clash with yours, and I hope you want to leave a comment to inform me and the rest of the world of this.

In short, I want to become a better software craftsperson, and I would like to invite you with me for the ride.

I definitely hope I won't bore you. :)
