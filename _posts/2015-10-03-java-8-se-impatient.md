tags: java8 java book readinggroup

My team is looking to migrate to Java 8 in the near future. As a first introduction to Java 8 we're doing a reading group of ["Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient" by Cay S. Horstmann](http://www.horstmann.com/java8/index.html). This post is just a quick listing of repositories of colleagues solving the solutions, for future reference and because it's too long to put in a tweet.
