My name is Vincent Verhoeven. I'm a software developer. I like agile methodologies, elegant code and chocolate. I dislike NullPointerExceptions and rainy weather. They're kind of the same thing anyway, aren't they?

You can find me and interact with me on the Internet! I usually go by the `verhoevenv` handle. Below are some aspects of my online life that might be interesting to you.

[^steam]:Don't judge my library. Steam sales are a mysterious and powerful force.
[^grouvee]:It's like IMDB for video games!
[^bgg]:I don't rate board games. For me the enjoyment is from social interaction, not inherent qualities of the game design. But don't make me play Uno.
