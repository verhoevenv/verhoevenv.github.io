You know the feeling when you have a new development machine, and everything is just... not right?

During the time I used Windows on my main machine, I didn't mind too much. I treated the new computer as a new possibility, starting over from scratch and installing what I needed, only when I needed it.

Now that I'm using Mac, however, It's way easier to keep my configuration up to date. Mac also doesn't seem to suffer slowness from unnecessary software as much as Windows used to do.

## Interesting parts of my configuration

### Things I have manually installed
I have these manually installed because they either self-update or update through the app store. Apps that don't provide automatic updates are installed through homebrew.

* IntelliJ
* XCode
* Chrome

### Homebrew
No Mac is complete without homebrew. My list of installed software...

```

```

### Git

Inside of my `.gitconfig`:

```
[alias]
	graphlog = log --graph --all --oneline --decorate
```

### Terminal
I use iTerm2 with ZSH and oh-my-zsh.

iTerm2 configuration:
* Font: 12 pt Droid Sans Mono for Powerline
* Non-ASCII Fond: 12 pt Droid Sans Mono Awesome


Parts of `.zshrc`
```
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel9k/powerlevel9k"
POWERLEVEL9K_MODE='awesome-patched'
POWERLEVEL9K_LEFT_PROMPT_ELEMENTS=(context dir vcs)
POWERLEVEL9K_RIGHT_PROMPT_ELEMENTS=(status time)

plugins=(git thefuck gradle zsh-autosuggestions)
```
